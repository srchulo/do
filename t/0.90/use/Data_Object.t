=description

This package aims to provide a modern Perl development framework and
foundational set of types, functions, classes, patterns, and interfaces for
jump-starting application development. This package inherits all behavior from
L<Data::Object::Config>.

+=head1 CONVENTION

Contrary to the opinion of some, modern Perl programming can be extremely
well-structured and beautiful, leveraging many advanced concepts found in other
languages, and some which aren't. Abilities like method modification also
referred to as augmentation, reflection, advanced object-orientation,
type-constrainable object attributes, type-constrainable subroutine signatures
(with named and positional arguments), as well roles (similar to mixins or
interfaces in other languages). This framework aims to serve as an entrypoint
to leveraging those abilities.

  use Do;

The "Do" package is an alias and subclass of this package. It encapsulates all
of the framework's features, is minimalist, and is meant to be the first import
in a new class or module.

  use Data::Object;

Both import statements are funcationally equivalent, enable the same
functionality, and can be configured equally. This is what's enabled whenever
you import the "Do" or "Data::Object" package into your namespace.

  # basics
  use strict;
  use warnings;

  # loads say, state, switch, etc
  use feature ':5.14';

  # loads type constraints
  use Data::Object::Library;

  # loads function/method signatures
  use Data::Object::Signatures;

  # imports keywords and super "do" function, etc
  use Data::Object::Export;

  # enables method calls on native data types
  use Data::Object::Autobox;

To explain by way of example: The following established a user-defined type
library where user-defined classes, roles, etc, will be automatically
registered.

  package App;

  use Do 'Library';

  1;

The following creates a class representing a user which has the ability to
greet another person. This class is type-library aware and will register itself
as a type constraint.

  package App::User;

  use Do 'Class', 'App';

  has name => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => 'Str',
    req => 1
  );

  method hello(AppUser $user) {
    return 'Hello '. $user->name .'. How are you?';
  }

  1;

The following is a script which is type-library aware that creates a function
that returns how one user greets another user.

  package main;

  use App::User;

  use Do 'Core', 'App';

  fun greetings(AppUser $u1, AppUser $u2) {
    return $u1->hello($u2);
  }

  my $u1 = User->new(name => 'Jane');
  my $u2 = User->new(name => 'June');

  say(greetings($u1, $u2)); # Hello June ...

This demonstrates much of the power of this framework in one simple example. If
you're new to Perl, the code above creates a class with a single (read-only
string) attribute called C<name> and a single method called C<hello>, then
registers the class in a user-defined type-library called C<App> where all
user-defined type constraints will be stored and retrieved (and reified). The
C<main> program (namespace) initializes the framework and specifies the
user-defined type library to use in the creation of a single function
C<greetings> which takes two arguments which must both be instances of the
class we just created.

+=head1 FRAMEWORK

Perl's multi-paradigm programming nature, flexibility and vast ecosystem that
many engineers already know and love.

+=head1 SLOGAN

If you're doing something modern with Perl, start here!

+=head1 INSTALLATION

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

  $ cpanm -qn Do

If you don't have cpanm, get it! It takes less than a minute, otherwise:

  $ curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - -qn Do

Add C<Do> to the list of dependencies in C<cpanfile>:

  requires "Do" => "1.75"; # 1.75 or newer

If cpanm doesn't have permission to install modules in the current Perl
installation, it will automatically set up and install to a local::lib in your
home directory.  See the L<local::lib|local::lib> documentation for details on
enabling it in your environment. We recommend using a
L<Perlbrew|https://github.com/gugod/app-perlbrew> or
L<Plenv|https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv> environment. These tools will help
you manage multiple Perl installations in your C<$HOME> directory. They are
completely isolated Perl installations.
