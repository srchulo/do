NAME

    Do

ABSTRACT

    Modern Perl

SYNOPSIS

      package main;
    
      use Do;
    
      fun greeting($name) {
        "Hello $name";
      }
    
      say greeting("world");
    
      1;

DESCRIPTION

    This package aims to provide a modern Perl development framework and
    foundational set of types, functions, classes, patterns, and interfaces
    for jump-starting application development. This package inherits all
    behavior from Data::Object; please see that documentation to learn
    more, or review Data::Object::Use.

INSTALLATION

    If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

      $ cpanm -qn Do

    If you don't have cpanm, get it! It takes less than a minute,
    otherwise:

      $ curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - -qn Do

    Add Do to the list of dependencies in cpanfile:

      requires "Do" => "1.80"; # 1.80 or newer

    If cpanm doesn't have permission to install modules in the current Perl
    installation, it will automatically set up and install to a local::lib
    in your home directory. See the local::lib documentation for details on
    enabling it in your environment. We recommend using a Perlbrew
    <https://github.com/gugod/app-perlbrew> or Plenv
    <https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv> environment. These tools will help
    you manage multiple Perl installations in your $HOME directory. They
    are completely isolated Perl installations.
