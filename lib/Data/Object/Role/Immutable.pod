=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a mechanism for making any L<Data::Object> data type
object immutable. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be
modified after it is created; Immutable objects are often useful because they
are inherently thread-safe, easier to reason about, and offer higher security
than mutable objects.

=cut
