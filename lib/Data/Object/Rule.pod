=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package modifies the consuming package making it a L<Moo> role, and is
used to allow you to specify rules for the consuming class. There is
functionally no difference between a role and a rule, so this concept only
exists to differentiate between that which describes an interface (rules) and
that which mixes-in behaviors.

=cut

=head1 INHERITS

This package inherits behaviors from:

L<Moo::Role>
