Data-Object Regex Class

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::Object::Search;

  my $result = Data::Object::Search->new([
    $regexp,
    $altered_string,
    $count,
    $last_match_end,
    $last_match_start,
    $named_captures,
    $initial_string
  ]);

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Data::Object::Search provides routines for introspecting the results of an
operation involving a regular expressions. These methods work on data whose
shape conforms to the tuple defined in the synopsis.

=cut

=head1 METHODS

This package implements the following methods.

=cut

=head2 captures

  my $captures = $result->captures();

The captures method returns the capture groups from the result object which
contains information about the results of the regular expression operation.

=cut

=head2 count

  my $count = $result->count();

The regexp method returns the regular expression used to perform the match from
the result object which contains information about the results of the regular
expression operation.

=cut

=head2 initial

  my $initial = $result->initial();

The initial method returns the unaltered string from the result object which
contains information about the results of the regular expression operation.

=cut

=head2 last_match_end

  my $last_match_end = $result->last_match_end();

The last_match_end method returns an array of offset positions into the string
where the capture(s) stopped matching from the result object which contains
information about the results of the regular expression operation.

=cut

=head2 last_match_start

  my $last_match_start = $result->last_match_start();

The last_match_start method returns an array of offset positions into the
string where the capture(s) matched from the result object which contains
information about the results of the regular expression operation.

=cut

=head2 named_captures

  my $named_captures = $result->named_captures();


The named_captures method returns a hash containing the requested named regular
expressions and captured string pairs from the result object which contains
information about the results of the regular expression operation.

=cut

=head2 matched

  my $matched = $result->matched();

The matched method returns the portion of the string that matched from the
result object which contains information about the results of the regular
expression operation.

=cut

=head2 prematched

  my $prematched = $result->prematched();

The prematched method returns the portion of the string before the regular
expression matched from the result object which contains information about the
results of the regular expression operation.

=cut

=head2 postmatched

  my $postmatched = $result->postmatched();

The postmatched method returns the portion of the string after the regular
expression matched from the result object which contains information about the
results of the regular expression operation.

=cut

=head2 regexp

  my $regexp = $result->regexp();

The regexp method returns the regular expression used to perform the match from
the result object which contains information about the results of the regular
expression operation.

=cut

=head2 string

  my $string = $result->string();

The string method returns the string matched against the regular expression
from the result object which contains information about the results of the
regular expression operation.
